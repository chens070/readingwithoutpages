                <p class="question"> Add: Hi Vincy, thanks for your time to chat with me. I am going to ask you some questions about you and regarding to art and design, feel free to say whatever you like </p>
                <p class="answer"> Hi! Yeah sure no problem, I'm happy to help.</p>

                <p class="question">Add: Where do you locate currently?</p>
                <p class="answer"> I live and work in Hong Kong</p>

                <p class="question">Add: What do you do for living? Could you describe a day in your job?</p>
                <p class="answer">I am an user experience designer by day, and I do illustrations on the side, both for fun and for commissions. I worked in a local company in Hong Kong as an in-house UX designer, my daily work consists of making wireframes and creating assets for the company's websites. I am also in charge of making the UI guidelines for the company's expanding web applications.</p>
                <p class="answer">After work I do illustrations and drawings in my free time to compensate for the creativity I didn't get to use for my day job. Coming from an illustration background, I wish I could spend more time on doing illustrations, but at the end of the day, going freelance on illustration is not sustainable for me to live in a city like Hong Kong. </p>

                <p class="question">Add: What are some of your habbits? Is there any relationship between your habits and your work?</p>
                <p class="answer">I have the habits of looking at strangers on the street and observe their behaviors and how they carry themselves with their body language. Sometimes I draw them in my notepad very quickly. I think it helps me with figuring out how I want to communicate with people with my drawings. </p>
                <p class="answer i2"><img src="assets/img/hug.gif"> </p>

                <p class="question">Add: As an artist or designer, How would you describe yourself? What is your goal</p>
                <p class="answer">I try to stay as open-minded as possible. Inspirations usually come from unexpected places.</p>
                <p class="answer">I don't set goals for anything in my life, but if I have to set a goal as a person working in a creative field, it would be to convince people that everyone can be artists, and that there is nothing fancy about being designers or artist:-) </p>

                <p class="question">Add: From the scale of 0 to 5. How likely do you think people from the rest of the world understands designs in your area?</p>
                <p class="answer"> I would say around 2.</p>

                <p class="question">Add: Would you mind sharing your portfolio website if you have one?</p>
                <p class="answer">Yeah of course, the link is</p>
                <p class="answer">
                  <a href="https://vincycheung.com/">vincycheung.com</a>
                </p>
              

                <p class="question">Add: Thank you! your portfolio is so cute and funny, I love it.</p>
                <p class="answer"> Thank you! great to hear</p>

                <p class="question">Add: What is your opinion about design/art in your area? What's special?   </p>
                <p class="answer">Illustrations is special because there are a lot of variations / possibilities to it. It's different from fine art which it's usually defined with different genre like realistic paintings, sculptures and mixed media etc. You cannot really put illustration in a box. Illustrations can be a lot of thing at the same time to me. For example, an illustration on a wall becomes a mural, when you make an illustration moves it becomes animation, when it's put on a card and packaging it becomes consumer goods. The possibility on how to use illustration is endless and that's the reason why I am attracted to it. People are immediately drawn to visually stimulating things and it makes direct conversation to whoever is looking at it.  </p>

                <p class="question">Add: What are the bias you think people has toward designs in your hometown/location *</p>
                <p class="answer">In terms of illustrations, I think people do not take it seriously. They might think illustrations are just doodles and there is nothing deep about it. In fact there are a lot of thoughts behind each stroke and color being used in each illustration.</p>

                <p class="question">Add: Do you get inspired by your culture? if so, how do you usually apply them in your work? </p>
                <p class="answer">Rather than culture, I would say I am more inspired by surroundings and personal experiences. If i live in a different city I will be inspired by that city and how I experienced it. </p>

                <p class="question">Add: In your opinion, What's the biggest different about design trend between Western and Eastern culture?</p>
                <p class="answer">I don't think I have the expertise to talk about that...but if I have to talk about it, here is my observation:</p>
                <p class="answer">In Hong Kong in particular, I think people are less adventurous on experimenting on new designs and ideas, they will not do something unless it's proven to be successful. I think that's the mindset that has affected people on thinking how design can be done. It's more about how design should be, not how it could be. </p>

                <p class="question">I went over your website, i really like this illustration, what was it for?</p>
                  <p class="question i1"><img src="assets/img/eyeball.gif"></p>
                <p class="answer">It was for an article that was published on Willamette Week, talking about pug's health problems. Here's more gifs </p>
                  <p class="answer i2"><img src="assets/img/fainting.gif"> </p>

                  <p class="answer i2"><img src="assets/img/panting.gif"></p>
                 
                 
                

                <p class="question">Add: These are great! So Vincy, What else do you wish to let people from other areas know about designs and art in your area? </p>
                <p class="answer">Use illustration wisely. Treat illustrators as a professionals like how you would treat architects and designers of other disciplines. </p>

                <p class="question">Add: Is there anything you would like me to know about you?</p>
                <p class="answer">I love eating. </p>
