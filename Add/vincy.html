                  <p>I am an user experience designer by day, and I do illustrations on the side, both for fun and for commissions. I worked in a local company in Hong Kong as an in-house UX designer, my daily work consists of making wireframes and creating assets for the company's websites. I am also in charge of making the UI guidelines for the company's expanding web applications.</p>

                  <p>After work I do illustrations and drawings in my free time to compensate for the creativity I didn't get to use for my day job. Coming from an illustration background, I wish I could spend more time on doing illustrations, but at the end of the day, going freelance on illustration is not sustainable for me to live in a city like Hong Kong. </p>

              <div class="answer">
                  <p>I have the habits of looking at strangers on the street and observe their behaviors and how they carry themselves with their body language. Sometimes I draw them in my notepad very quickly. I think it helps me with figuring out how I want to communicate with people with my drawings. </p>

                  <p>I don't set goals for anything in my life, but if I have to set a goal as a person working in a creative field, it would be to convince people that everyone can be artists, and that there is nothing fancy about being designers or artist:-) </p>

                <p class="question">What is your opinion about design/art in your area? What's special?   </p>
              
              <div class="profile"><img src="assets/img/vincyprofile.jpg"></div>
              <div class="answer">
                <p>Illustrations is special because there are a lot of variations / possibilities to it. It's different from fine art which it's usually defined with different genre like realistic paintings, sculptures and mixed media etc. You cannot really put illustration in a box. Illustrations can be a lot of thing at the same time to me. For example, an illustration on a wall becomes a mural, when you make an illustration moves it becomes animation, when it's put on a card and packaging it becomes consumer goods. The possibility on how to use illustration is endless and that's the reason why I am attracted to it. People are immediately drawn to visually stimulating things and it makes direct conversation to whoever is looking at it.  </p>

                <p class="question">What are the bias you think people has toward designs in your hometown/location?</p>
              <div class="profile"><img src="assets/img/vincyprofile.jpg"></div>
                <div class="answer">
                <p>In terms of illustrations, I think people do not take it seriously. They might think illustrations are just doodles and there is nothing deep about it. In fact there are a lot of thoughts behind each stroke and color being used in each illustration.</p>
              </div>

                <p class="question">Do you get inspired by your culture? if so, how do you usually apply them in your work? </p>
                
                <div class="profile"><img src="assets/img/vincyprofile.jpg"></div>
              <div class="answer">
                  <p>Rather than culture, I would say I am more inspired by surroundings and personal experiences. If i live in a different city I will be inspired by that city and how I experienced it. </p>
              </div>

                <p class="question">In your opinion, What's the biggest different about design trend between Western and Eastern culture?</p>
              <div class="profile"><img src="assets/img/vincyprofile.jpg"></div>
              <div class="answer">
                  <p>I don't think I have the expertise to talk about that...but if I have to talk about it, here is my observation:</p>
                  <p>In Hong Kong in particular, I think people are less adventurous on experimenting on new designs and ideas, they will not do something unless it's proven to be successful. I think that's the mindset that has affected people on thinking how design can be done. It's more about how design should be, not how it could be. </p>

                <div class="answer">
                  <p>Use illustration wisely. Treat illustrators as a professionals like how you would treat architects and designers of other disciplines. </p>
