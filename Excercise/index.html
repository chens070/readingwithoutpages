    <h3>Teenagers Are Still Eating Tide Pods, But Don't Expect A Product Redesign</h3>
    <p>Previously, Tide Pods drew national attention — and criticism of their design — when young children became ill after putting them in their mouths. Every year, poison control centers get more than 10,000 of reports of children accidentally getting their hands on laundry packets.</br>
    Procter & Gamble has responded by making the container opaque, and coating the packets in a thicker plastic that's harder to bite through as well as a very bitter substance meant to prompt a child to spit it out.</br>
    But the Tide Pod Challenge is different. It involves grown children knowingly choosing to bite into a packet clearly advertised as laundry detergent, which is obviously toxic.</br>
    "I think there's a clear distinction between an accidental ingestion by someone who is making an honest mistake versus people who, I would argue, should know better about putting household cleaners in their mouth," Jones says. "Many people are doing this not seriously, they're doing this jokingly. ... This is clearly a case of a joke gone too far."</br>
    But why would a laundry packet be designed so candy-like to begin with?</br>
    Designs like this are never willy-nilly, says Chris Livaudais, executive director of the Industrial Designers Society of America. The process starts by studying the habits of a potential user to find ways to make their life better in some way. In this case, the condensed formula does away with a heavy jug and the need for measurement.</br>
    And package design "plays into the psyche of the person shopping to see a product and believe in its value and use it," Livaudais says. In other words, we shop with our eyes — even for laundry detergent.</br>
    The colors are already associated with liquid detergent, Livaudais says. And the swirls "might imply how active the ingredients are and how well it would do the washing job."</br>
    Jones says the swirls were indeed a design choice — indicating that the pod brings together three ingredients (cleaning, stain-fighting and brightening, he says). The pod is transparent because customers have told Tide they like to know what they're putting into the wash with their clothes.</br>
    Livaudais says industrial designers spend a lot of time mulling best and worst case scenarios for the use of products. But if someone knowingly chooses to misuse them? "That's completely out of our hands," he says.</p>

      <h3> Amazon 5 stars reviews </h3>

      <p>"The best way to liven up pizza and pasta!"</br> -By Marc T</p>

      <p>
        "Great pods!
        I used them on my pizza and they where so good, I can't recommend thim any more, just buy them!
        And for all people saying that tide pods are bad, is because thay don't want you to experience new things."</br>-By Jalal</p>
        
       <p> "I love them! Everything about them is perfect!
        They taste amazing, the plastic and detergent give a nice feel, and the flavor is just exquisite!
        Couldn't recommend these enough as an amazing meal . Goes great with a cup of bleach." </br>-By Trippy</p>
      </p>

      <p>"I would definitely recommend these as a midnight snack or just a quick treat while on the go! Burn a tiny bit in your mouth but if you push that aside they’re wonderful! 5 stars!"
      </br> -By Susanna T.

      <p>"A flavor like no other, I've been using these for years as a flavor enhancer for my water. The only issue is that they have a hard time dissolving in my Yeti cup, so I've started extracting the liquid goo with a needle and then squirting it into my water.” They go on to describe the weight-loss benefits to eating Tide Pops. Please don’t do this."</br> -By ¿$©¢£€</p>
